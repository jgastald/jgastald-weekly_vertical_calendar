WEEKLY VERTICAL CALENDAR
====== ======== ========

As Ireneusz Skrobis, the original developer of weekly_vertical_calendar, said:
"This is another way for displaying weekly calendar, but this time it is vertical."

It's a generator that can be executed running:

  rails generate weekly_vertical_calendar <model_name>

The model needs two fields:
  start_at (datetime)
  end_at (datetime)


Requires Rails 3.1.2+.

In the future I will add more parametrization options, as well cleaning up the code
(it's pretty messy right now)
